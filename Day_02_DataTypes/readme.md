Java has eight primitive data types, which can be categorized into four groups.

### Integer
- `byte`: 8-bit signed integer Range: -128 to 127
- `short` : 16-bit signed integer Range -32,768 to 32,767
- `int` : 32-bit signed integer Range -2^31 to 2^31 -1
- `long` : 64-bit signed integer Range -2^63 to 2^63-1

### Floating-Point Types 
- `float`: 32-bit floating-point numbers, Range approx +- 3.40282347E+38F
- `double` : 64-bit floating-point number, Range approx +- 1.79769313486231570E+308

### Character Type
- `char` : 16-bit unicode character. Represents a single character.
